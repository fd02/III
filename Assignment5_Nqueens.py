""" The time complexity is approximately O(N!):
Each recursive call attempts to place a queen in every possible column in the current row and then recursively tries to solve the next row. This branching makes the time complexity grow factorially with N.

We need O(N^2) space to store the board itself since we're using an NÃ—N matrix."""
